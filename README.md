# Coffee Preference Analysis

## Introduction
This research investigates the significant role of coffee in modern global culture, focusing on consumer preferences related to flavor, price, and branding. With the increasing competitiveness of the coffee market, understanding these preferences is essential for enhancing customer satisfaction and brand loyalty. The study aims to identify key factors influencing coffee purchasing decisions—such as taste, price, and brand—using survey and sampling methods to gather accurate data. By measuring variables like age, gender, coffee consumption frequency, and purchasing experiences, the research seeks to provide valuable insights for the coffee industry and contribute to the academic understanding of consumer behavior.
For this research, data was collected independently (primary data).

## Methodology
Data collection : Questionnaire (with a result of 171 valid data)
Data preprocessing : renaming columns, removed open-ended questions, missing value imputation
Data quality checking : Pearson's Correlation Coefficient (validity), Cronbach’s
alpha (reliability), response bias calculation

## Conclusion
The research provided a comprehensive overview of coffee consumption preferences among students and workers, identifying key variables such as consumption frequency, price preferences, and brewing methods. Despite improvements in data quality and random sampling to reduce bias, the survey's reliability was low, indicating inconsistencies and potential response bias due to limited answer options.

## Future Analysis Plans
To understand coffee consumer preferences, the first step involves market segmentation analysis using collected data to group consumers based on demographics and consumption behavior through clustering techniques like K-Means or Hierarchical Clustering. Following this, regression analysis will identify key factors influencing coffee purchasing decisions, while conjoint analysis will measure the relative value of various coffee attributes, providing producers with valuable insights for product development and targeted marketing strategies.
